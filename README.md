Projects in Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision — from wildfire detection to AI-powered podcast generation.

## Featured Projects
[MicDrop: AI-Powered Podcast Generation](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/micdrop-notebooklm-gpt)
- An end-to-end NLP pipeline that transforms articles into conversational audio. This project's core is a DistilGPT2 model fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o. I built the system using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to create a custom, lightweight text-to-podcast engine.

[FireSat-Lite: Deep Learning Wildfire Detection](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/firesat-lite)
- I engineered a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras to predict wildfires from a 43K-image dataset. By implementing a methodologically rigorous pipeline with strategic Dropout, the model achieved a final 95.30% test accuracy, significantly improving generalization over baseline models.

Projects in Deep Learning, NLP, and Predictive Modeling â€” from wildfire detection to AI-powered podcast generation.

## Featured Projects
[MicDrop: AI-Powered Podcast Generation](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/micdrop-notebooklm-gpt)
- An end-to-end NLP pipeline that transforms articles into conversational audio. This project's core is a DistilGPT2 model fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o. I built the system using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to create a custom, lightweight text-to-podcast engine.

[FireSat-Lite: Deep Learning Wildfire Detection](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/firesat-lite)
- I engineered a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras to predict wildfires from a 43K-image dataset. By implementing data augmentation and Dropout for improved generalization, the model achieved 95.9% test accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline models.

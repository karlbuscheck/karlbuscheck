## “Turning data into insights, one notebook at a time.”

Hey, I’m Karl—an MBA candidate who loves working in Jupyter Notebooks and building machine learning models that dig into real-world problems.

Lately, I’ve been focused on the podcast industry—exploring what drives rankings, and success. I write about it all at [Leavey Ventures](https://leaveyventures.substack.com)-my "comment line" for *all* my projects, notebooks and beyond.

## Favorite Tools
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NotebookLM

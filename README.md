## “Turning data into insight, one notebook at a time.”

Hey, I’m Karl—an MBA candidate who loves working in Jupyter Notebooks and building machine learning models that dig into real-world problems.

My work is largely focused on the podcast and broader content industry—exploring what drives success. I write about it all at [Leavey Ventures](https://leaveyventures.substack.com)—my "comment line" for *all* my projects, notebooks, and beyond.

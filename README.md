Projects in Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision — from wildfire detection to AI-powered podcast generation.

## Featured Projects
[MicDrop: AI-Powered Podcast Generation](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/micdrop-notebooklm-gpt)
- An end-to-end NLP pipeline that transforms articles into conversational audio. This project's core is a DistilGPT2 model fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o. I built the system using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to create a custom, lightweight text-to-podcast engine.

[Merlin: What-If Engine for YouTube Creators](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/merlin)
- A hybrid transformer + XGBoost system that predicts lifetime views and subscriber change before a video goes live. Generates title embeddings with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and combines them with episode metadata for fast, directionally reliable forecasts. Available as a fully interactive web app for real-time what-if testing of titles and release decisions.

[FireSat-Lite: Deep Learning Wildfire Detection](https://github.com/karlbuscheck/firesat-lite)
- A production-style CNN trained on a 43K-image wildfire dataset (Fire, Smoke, Non-Fire). The project implements a clean, reproducible pipeline with fixed train/val/test splits, data augmentation, and strategic dropout to combat overfitting. The final model achieved 95.30% test accuracy, outperforming baseline architectures on a challenging, safety-critical task.
